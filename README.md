# Crypto-fud-generator
>Simple random phrase generator to create false news headlines that will send the markets "to the moon" or the depths of despair!

This is a small project i built to apply what I was learning in Python into a real world application.  It is heavily inspired by the hugely entertaining 'Daily Mail Headline generator' written by Chris Applegate(www.qwghlm.co.uk)

It's quite a basic random phrase generator, which picks out phrases from pre-defined lists and concatenates into the crypto news statement.

I'm still new to programming, but find it immensely enjoyable. If you take a look and have any suggestions, please feel free to drop me a comment!
